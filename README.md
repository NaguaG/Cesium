# Cesium

## Intro 
This is Materials Management component of Smart Construction Dashboard which allows users to create and edit a catalog of materials, such as sand, gravel, and dirt, for construction projects. I spent around 5 hours on the project. The additional time was mainly dedicated to familiarizing myself with Jasmine tests, as I hadn't used them before. During the development process, I had some ideas to improve the project further. Specifically, I thought about adding some functional buttons and making slight design modifications. However, considering the time constraint and the project's original requirements, I decided to stick with the initial specifications. But I add a "RESET" button that clears all inputs. I found the project to be incredibly fascinating and engaging throughout the development process. It provided me with an excellent opportunity to apply my skills and explore new concepts. I thoroughly enjoyed working on it
